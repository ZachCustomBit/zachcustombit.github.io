Sometimes I am asked what kind of music I listen to, and so I thought I would share some of my current favorite playlists. First of all, I use Spotify to satisfy all of my music needs. I can stream whatever I want, because wherever I go there is WiFi. I use it on my Phone, Laptop, Airplay it to my TV, and sometimes even on the iPad.

Some of my favorite playlists include:

* [Zach](https://open.spotify.com/user/spencerismyfave/playlist/2g1lf2THTSTSY3ESLI88Bm) A playlist made by my wife just for me, if you are looking for Love/Country Songs you'll want this one.
* [Worded songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1256692136/playlist/2aMFCn2oXCctBfH0GiLIx0) A playlist by the up and coming DJ Phillip Witherspoon. You'll find it is mostly newer alternative, but who doesn't like that?
* [At Work](https://open.spotify.com/user/digster.fm/playlist/0Gy1TwCxPFTMCiwxGLVkc1) A playlist by Digster Playlists great for writing a ton of code.
* [Top 25](https://open.spotify.com/user/1256692136/playlist/2L5A49RgoPSHQD0y8XXdun) Another playist by Phillip Witherspoon. It changes constantly based on new and upcoming music.
* [Have a Great Day!](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/2PXdUld4Ueio2pHcB6sM8j) A playlist curated by Spotify that will make you happy no matter what.
